### üîß Core Components

| Component                | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM Backbone**         | OpenAI GPT-4 (via `Github Models`) ‚Äì Handles medical reasoning, triage logic, and natural language generation.         |
| **Conversational Chain** | Built using the `CrewAI` framework with a custom `ConversationalAgent` logic for task delegation and memory handling.  |
| **Prompt Layer**         | Domain-specific prompt templates crafted to guide medical inference and decision-making.                               |
| **Tools**                | Web-enhanced capabilities via LangChain Tool abstraction, including search and scraping (see below).                   |
| **Streamlit Frontend**   | Provides an intuitive interface for symptom input and returns structured, explainable medical feedback.                |

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Overview

The agent leverages tools to enhance factual accuracy and access real-time information:

#### üîç DuckDuckGo Search Tool
- **Function**: Performs real-time web searches for symptoms, conditions, and recent health-related updates.
- **Implementation**: `DuckDuckGoSearchResults` via LangChain.
- **Purpose**: Assists the agent in retrieving recent or unknown data not embedded in the model.

#### üß™ Web Scraping Tool
- **Function**: Extracts medical content from trusted sources using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Safeguards**: Domain whitelisting ensures reliability and medical accuracy.
- **Use Case**: Activated when high-precision, structured information is needed (e.g., MedlinePlus or NIH articles).
